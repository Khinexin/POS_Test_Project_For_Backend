# Test Project for Back-end Engineer


## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.mytest.pos.PosApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
$ mvn clean install
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Libraries used
- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC (Spring Web)
- Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
- Spring for GraphQL
- MySql
- lombok

## Configure MySQL
- Update the application.properties file in the `src/main/resources` folder with the URL, 'username' and 'password' for your MySQL instance. The table schema for the Sales objects will be created for you in the database.
